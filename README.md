**Problem Statement**
**Problem Statement: Uber Trip Analysis**

**Uber needs to understand its trip patterns, revenue, and operational efficiency to make data-driven decisions. Challenges include identifying peak hours, high-demand locations, vehicle utilization, and revenue trends while handling large volumes of trip data. The goal of this project is to build interactive dashboards that provide insights into bookings, trip distances, durations, and payment types, enabling stakeholders to optimize driver allocation, pricing, and overall service quality.**

**Steps followed**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow for Uber trip data:

***1. Prerequisites & Setup :** Configured AWS S3 for raw data storage, integrated Snowflake as a scalable data warehouse, and established Power BIâ€“Snowflake connection via Power BI Service for seamless reporting.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Performed data cleaning (handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates) to ensure dataset accuracy and consistency.

**3. Data Modeling:** Built a robust data model with relationships, calendar tables, and measure tables for accurate time intelligence and KPI tracking.

**4. Reporting & Dashboards:** Designed 3 interactive dashboards (Overview, Time Analysis, and Details) with KPIs including total trips, revenue, customer insights, and regional trends.

**5. Advanced Interactivity:** Implemented drill-through, bookmarks, and toggle features for enhanced user exploration and self-service analytics.

**6. Deployment & Automation:** Published the report to Power BI Service and scheduled data refreshes to keep dashboards updated with the latest data.

**7. Documentation & Collaboration:** Published full project documentation and reports on GitHub, including datasets, DAX measures, and development process for reproducibility.
